## Explanation of the Class:
- **@Getter and @Setter (Lombok):**

    These annotations automatically generate the getter and setter methods for all fields in the class, eliminating the need to write them manually. For example, instead of writing:

    java

    Copy

    Edit

        public Long getId() { return id; }
        public void setId(Long id) { this.id = id; }
        Lombok will automatically generate them.

## @NoArgsConstructor and @AllArgsConstructor (Lombok):

- **@NoArgsConstructor:** This annotation generates a constructor with no arguments (i.e., a default constructor). This is important because JPA requires a no-args constructor to create entities dynamically.

- **@AllArgsConstructor:** This annotation generates a constructor that takes all the fields as arguments. This is useful for creating objects with all fields initialized at once.

## @Entity:

Marks the User class as a JPA entity. JPA will map this class to a table in the database. The table name is specified by the @Table(name = "users") annotation.

- **@Table(name = "users"):**

    This annotation specifies the name of the database table to which this entity corresponds. In this case, the User entity will be mapped to the table users.

    @Id and @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY):

    @Id marks the id field as the primary key for the User entity.

- **@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)** tells JPA to automatically generate the id value using an identity column, meaning it will be auto-incremented in the database.

- **@Column(unique = true):**

    This annotation specifies that the username field must be unique in the database. This ensures that no two users can have the same username.

- **private Long id:**

    This is the unique identifier (primary key) for each user in the database.

- **private String username:**

    This is the username of the user. It is a required field and must be unique.

- **private String password:**

    This is the password field. It stores the user's password, which should typically be hashed for security reasons (e.g., using a PasswordEncoder).

- **Usage in a Spring Boot Application:**

  This class would typically be used with JPA repositories to perform CRUD operations. For example, you might create a UserRepository interface to interact with the users table in the database.

**Lombok** 

simplifies the code, reducing boilerplate for getters, setters, and constructors, improving readability and maintainability.

**Security Consideration:**

Password Storage: Passwords should never be stored as plain text in the database. You should hash the password before saving it, which is why a PasswordEncoder (such as BCryptPasswordEncoder) is typically used in Spring Security when handling user registration and login.
