## Detailed Breakdown:

**Annotations:**

@Service: Marks this class as a Spring service, which allows it to be injected into other components, like controllers or security configurations.

UserRepository userRepository:

This is injected with @Autowired. It is used to interact with the database and retrieve user data based on the username.

loadUserByUsername(String username):

This is the core method implemented from the UserDetailsService interface, which Spring Security uses to load user details for authentication.

userRepository.findByUsername(username): This method is called to retrieve the user from the database by their username.

If no user is found with the given username, the method throws a UsernameNotFoundException, which is a standard exception used in Spring Security for such cases.

new org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User(): If the user is found, a UserDetails object is returned. This object contains:

user.getUsername(): The username of the user.

user.getPassword(): The password of the user (which should be hashed, not plain text).

Collections.emptyList(): An empty list is passed as authorities, meaning no roles or permissions are defined here. In a real-world scenario, this could be populated with the user's roles or authorities.

Why Collections.emptyList()?

In this code, the user's authorities (roles) are not used, so an empty list is passed. In a more complete implementation, you would query for the user's roles and pass them here to manage permissions.

## Summary:

The CustomUserDetailsService class is used to integrate a custom user loading mechanism into Spring Security. It fetches the user details from the database using the UserRepository and returns a UserDetails object that Spring Security can use for authentication and authorization. In this simple case, no authorities (roles/permissions) are assigned to the user, but you can extend this to include role-based access control by fetching the user's roles from the database and adding them to the returned UserDetails.
