## Explanation:
- **@RestController:** This annotation marks the class as a REST controller, indicating that the methods inside the class will handle HTTP requests and return the responses directly (usually as JSON or plain text).

- **@RequestMapping("/api/test"):** This is the base URL for all endpoints in the TestController. All the methods in this controller will be prefixed with /api/test. For example:

  - **The allAccess()** method will be available at /api/test/all.

  - **The userAccess()** method will be available at /api/test/user.

- **@GetMapping("/all"):** This annotation is used to map HTTP GET requests to the allAccess() method. When a GET request is made to /api/test/all, this method will be executed. It returns the string "Public Content.".

- **@GetMapping("/user"):** This annotation maps HTTP GET requests to the userAccess() method. A GET request to /api/test/user will trigger this method, which returns the string "User Content.".

## Flow:
- **The /api/test/all** endpoint is designed to serve public content. Anyone (authenticated or not) can access this endpoint.

- **The /api/test/user** endpoint is presumably meant to return content for authenticated users, though there is no authentication mechanism implemented here (in a real application, you'd want to add security such as JWT or OAuth2 to protect this endpoint).

# Possible Enhancements:
- **Security:** You might want to add security to the /user endpoint to ensure itâ€™s only accessible to authenticated users (e.g., using Spring Security).

- **Error handling:** Add error handling for scenarios where content might not be available or accessible due to permission issues.
