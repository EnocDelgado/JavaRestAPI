## Explanation of the Code:

- **AuthenticationManager:** This is used to authenticate the user credentials. It takes a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken, which contains the username and password provided by the client.

- **JwtUtil:** This utility is responsible for generating a JWT (JSON Web Token) after successful authentication. The token is used to securely authenticate API requests in subsequent interactions.

- **UserRepository:** This is the interface for interacting with the database. It provides methods to check if a username already exists and to save new users.

- **PasswordEncoder:** This is used to encode the password before saving it to the database. Storing passwords in plain text is a security risk, so encoding is crucial for safe storage.

- **/signin endpoint:** This endpoint allows users to log in by providing their username and password. Upon successful authentication, it generates and returns a JWT token.

- **/signup endpoint:*** This endpoint allows users to register a new account. It checks if the username is already taken, and if not, it saves the user to the database with an encoded password.

## Flow:
- The client sends a POST request to /api/auth/signup with the user's username and password to register.

- The controller checks if the username exists.

- If it doesn't exist, it saves the user with the encoded password.

- The client sends a POST request to /api/auth/signin with the user's username and password to log in.

- The AuthenticationManager authenticates the credentials.

- If authentication is successful, it generates and returns a JWT token.

- This code provides basic functionality for handling user authentication and registration with JWT tokens. You might want to enhance it by adding more validation, custom exception handling, and additional security measures (e.g., password strength validation).
