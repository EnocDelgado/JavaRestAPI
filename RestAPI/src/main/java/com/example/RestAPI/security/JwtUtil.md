Explanation:
@Component:

The @Component annotation registers this class as a Spring-managed bean, so it can be autowired into other Spring components such as controllers, services, or filters.

@Value:

The @Value annotation is used to inject values from the application configuration (e.g., application.properties or application.yml) into the class fields.

jwt.secret: The secret key used to sign the JWT tokens.

jwt.expiration: The expiration time for the JWT tokens in milliseconds.

SecretKey key:

This field is used to store the secret key that will be used to sign and verify JWT tokens. It is initialized in the @PostConstruct method to avoid repeated creation of the key.

@PostConstruct:

The init method is annotated with @PostConstruct and is invoked after the class is instantiated and all dependencies are injected. This is where the SecretKey is created from the jwtSecret string using the HMACSHA256 algorithm.

Keys.hmacShaKeyFor() converts the secret string into a cryptographic key used for signing and validating JWT tokens.

generateToken:

This method creates a JWT token for a given username. It sets the username as the subject of the token, the current date and time as the issued date, and the expiration date based on the configured jwtExpirationMs value.

The token is signed using the secret key and the HS256 signing algorithm.

Jwts.builder(): Creates a builder for constructing a JWT.

signWith(key, SignatureAlgorithm.HS256): Signs the JWT using the provided secret key and the HS256 algorithm.

getUsernameFromToken:

This method extracts the username from a given JWT token by parsing it using the secret key.

Jwts.parserBuilder(): Creates a builder for parsing the JWT.

parseClaimsJws(token): Parses the JWT and retrieves the claims (payload) from the token.

getSubject(): Extracts the subject (username) from the claims of the token.

validateJwtToken:

This method validates the JWT token by attempting to parse it and catching different exceptions for various validation issues (e.g., signature mismatch, expiration, malformed token).

If the token is valid, it returns true. Otherwise, it prints an error message to the console and returns false.

The different exceptions that can be caught include:

SecurityException: If the JWT's signature is invalid.

MalformedJwtException: If the token is not correctly structured.

ExpiredJwtException: If the token has expired.

UnsupportedJwtException: If the JWT format is unsupported.

IllegalArgumentException: If the JWT's claims string is empty.

How This Class Works:
Token Generation: The generateToken method is used to generate JWT tokens for a user. It includes the username, issue time, and expiration time in the token's claims. The token is signed with a secret key using the HMACSHA256 algorithm.

Token Validation: The validateJwtToken method checks if a given JWT token is valid by verifying the signature and other aspects such as expiration, format, and claims.

Username Extraction: The getUsernameFromToken method allows the extraction of the username from a valid JWT token, which can be used to load the user details from the database.

Usage:
JWT Creation: When a user logs in or performs an action requiring authentication, the server generates a JWT token and sends it back to the client.

JWT Validation: Every time the client makes a request with the token (usually in the Authorization header), this class can be used to validate the token and extract the username for further processing (e.g., authenticating the user, checking roles, etc.).

Potential Enhancements:
Error Handling: You could extend error handling to include more detailed logging or throw custom exceptions instead of just printing the error messages to the console.

Custom Expiration Logic: Instead of hardcoding the expiration logic in the generateToken method, you could provide more flexibility by allowing dynamic expiration times based on the user or request type.

Algorithm Choice: You could make the signing algorithm configurable, allowing support for different JWT signing algorithms like RS256.

This class plays a central role in handling JWT-based authentication, ensuring tokens are correctly generated, validated, and used in a Spring Security environment.
