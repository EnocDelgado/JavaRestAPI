Explanation:
@Component:

The @Component annotation marks this class as a Spring-managed bean. This allows Spring to automatically instantiate and inject this filter into the applicationâ€™s filter chain.

extends OncePerRequestFilter:

The OncePerRequestFilter is a Spring Security filter that guarantees the filter will be executed once per request. This ensures that it processes the request before passing it along the filter chain.

This is useful to ensure JWT token validation happens only once per HTTP request.

@Autowired:

jwtUtils: A utility class that provides methods to parse and validate JWT tokens.

userDetailsService: A custom service (CustomUserDetailsService) that loads user details from the database by username, which is used for setting the authentication object in the security context.

doFilterInternal method:

This method is overridden from the OncePerRequestFilter class and is the core logic of the filter. It is responsible for checking the presence and validity of the JWT token, loading the user details, and setting the authentication in the Spring Security context.

Steps:

The JWT token is extracted from the Authorization header using the parseJwt method.

If the token is valid (checked by jwtUtils.validateJwtToken(jwt)), the username is extracted from the token.

The userDetailsService is used to load the user details from the database.

A UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken is created using the user details and granted authorities (roles).

The authentication object is then set into the Spring Security context via SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication).

parseJwt method:

This method extracts the JWT token from the Authorization header of the HTTP request. It checks if the header starts with the string "Bearer " (a common convention for passing tokens) and returns the token portion. If the header is not in the expected format, it returns null.

JWT Token Handling:

jwtUtils.validateJwtToken(jwt): This checks if the token is valid (e.g., not expired or tampered with).

jwtUtils.getUsernameFromToken(jwt): This extracts the username from the valid JWT token. This username will be used to load the user details from the database.

Authentication Process:

Once the JWT token is validated and the user details are loaded, an instance of UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken is created. This represents the authenticated user along with their roles.

authentication.setDetails(new WebAuthenticationDetailsSource().buildDetails(request)): This adds additional authentication details, such as the client's IP address and session ID, to the authentication object.

SecurityContextHolder.getContext().setAuthentication(authentication): This sets the authentication context, making the authenticated user available for further processing in the request lifecycle (e.g., access control, authorization).

How This Filter Works:
When an HTTP request is made to the server, the AuthTokenFilter intercepts the request before it reaches the actual endpoint.

It extracts the JWT token from the Authorization header and validates it.

If the token is valid, it extracts the username and loads the corresponding user details using CustomUserDetailsService.

The filter creates an Authentication object (of type UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken) and places it in the SecurityContextHolder.

This allows subsequent security filters to know that the request is from an authenticated user.

Finally, the filter passes the request along the filter chain.

Benefits of This Filter:
JWT-based authentication: It allows for stateless authentication based on JWT tokens, which is often used in REST APIs and microservices.

Security: By validating the JWT token and ensuring the user is authenticated, it helps secure access to protected resources.

Flexibility: It integrates seamlessly with Spring Security, ensuring that only authenticated users can access protected endpoints.

Potential Enhancements:
Logging: You may want to log authentication attempts and errors for auditing purposes.

Error Handling: You could enhance the error handling (e.g., logging the exception, sending a response with a clear error message).

Custom Exception Handling: If the token is invalid or expired, instead of just logging an error, you could return a custom error response to the client.

This filter plays a critical role in handling JWT-based authentication for REST APIs in Spring Security, ensuring only authenticated users can access certain resources.
