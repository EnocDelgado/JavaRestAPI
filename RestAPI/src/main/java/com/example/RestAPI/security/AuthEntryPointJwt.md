Explanation:
@Component:

The @Component annotation marks this class as a Spring Bean, making it eligible for dependency injection into other Spring components. This allows the AuthEntryPointJwt to be automatically managed by the Spring container.

implements AuthenticationEntryPoint:

The AuthenticationEntryPoint interface is part of Spring Security, and it defines a method (commence) that is called whenever an authentication exception occurs (e.g., when a user attempts to access a protected resource without proper authentication).

By implementing this interface, we can customize the behavior of the system when an unauthenticated user tries to access a secured resource.

commence method:

This method is called when the user attempts to access a resource without proper authentication or authorization.

Parameters:

HttpServletRequest request: Represents the incoming HTTP request.

HttpServletResponse response: Represents the outgoing HTTP response. This is used to send the response back to the client.

AuthenticationException authException: This exception is thrown when authentication fails (e.g., when no valid authentication token is provided).

response.sendError(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED, "Error: Unauthorized");:

This line sends an HTTP response with a 401 Unauthorized status code. The sendError method sets the response status code and provides a custom message that will be included in the response body.

HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED is a constant that represents the HTTP status code 401, indicating that the request lacks valid authentication credentials.

"Error: Unauthorized" is a custom message that will be sent to the client, explaining the reason for the error.

How This Class Works:
The AuthEntryPointJwt class is designed to handle situations where an unauthenticated user attempts to access a protected resource.

When such a request is made, the commence method is triggered, which sends an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response to the client.

This custom entry point provides more control over the error message and the HTTP response that is sent back to the client when authentication fails.

When Does This Class Get Used?
This custom AuthenticationEntryPoint is useful in a Spring Security setup where the application is secured with JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

If a user tries to access a protected API endpoint without providing a valid JWT or if the JWT is expired, the commence method will send the 401 Unauthorized response to the client.

Example Flow:
A user tries to access a protected API endpoint (e.g., /api/user).

The server checks for the presence of a valid JWT token in the request.

If no valid token is found or the token is invalid/expired, the commence method of AuthEntryPointJwt is invoked.

The server responds with a 401 Unauthorized status code and a custom message ("Error: Unauthorized").

The client receives the 401 Unauthorized response and can handle it appropriately, for example, by prompting the user to log in again.

Potential Enhancements:
Logging: You could add logging to track unauthorized access attempts for security auditing purposes.

log.error("Unauthorized access attempt: " + request.getRequestURI());
Custom Error Message: You could customize the error message further or even include details like the required authentication method.

Different Responses for Different Exceptions: You can customize the response for different types of authentication failures (e.g., invalid token vs. missing token).

This class plays a crucial role in a Spring Security setup where authentication and authorization need to be tightly controlled, especially in the context of token-based authentication systems like JWT.
